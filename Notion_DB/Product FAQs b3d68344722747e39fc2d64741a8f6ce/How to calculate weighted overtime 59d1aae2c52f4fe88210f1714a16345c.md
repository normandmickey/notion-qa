Calculating weighted overtime is a step-by-step process that can take time to evaluate, even for experienced payroll professionals.

1. Total the regular earnings by adding together the regular wages multiplied by the hours worked at each wage.
2. Divide the total regular earnings for the pay period by the number of hours worked in total to find the weighted average pay rate.
3. Multiply the average pay rate by 0.5 to calculate the additional overtime rate.
4. Multiply the additional overtime rate by the number of overtime hours worked to determine your additional overtime wages owed.
5. Add the overtime wage to the total regular wage to find the total wages due.
