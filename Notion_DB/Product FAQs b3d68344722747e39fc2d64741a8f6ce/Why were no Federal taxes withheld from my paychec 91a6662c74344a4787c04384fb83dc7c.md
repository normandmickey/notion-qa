Starting in 2020 the Federal W4 ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf)) was changed to accommodate a new withholding tax calculation.  Filing status is no longer expressed as simply “marital status plus a number of dependents”.  

The variables used to calculate taxes are as follows.

- Marital Status (S/M/H)
- Multiple incomes or spouse works
- Tax credits ($2000 per year for dependent child under 17 and $500 per year for dependents 17 or older).

The Federal Standard Deductions for 2023 are as follows. 

- Single - $13,850
- Head of Household - $20,800
- Married Filling Joint - $27,700

Payroll software calculates taxable income by annualizing the current check and subtracting the standard deduction.  The taxable income for a person making $750 per week claiming Married, Single Income and $500 in tax credits (one child aged 17) would be calculated as follows 

1. Annualized income = $39,000 ($750 x 52 = $39,000)
2. Taxable income = $11,300 ($39,000 - $27,700 = $11,300)

The annualized federal tax is then calculated using the table below and then the tax credits are subtracted to get an annualized tax. 

- 10%	$0 to $15,700.	10% of taxable income.
- 12%	$15,701 to $59,850.	$1,570 plus 12% of the amount over $15,700.
- 22%	$59,851 to $95,350.	$6,868 plus 22% of the amount over $59,850.
- 24%	$95,351 to $182,100. $14,678 plus 24% of the amount over $95,350.

Using the example above this persons annualized tax would be $630.00.

- Annualized Tax = $630 (($11,300 x 0.10) - $500 = $630)

The annualized tax is then divided by the number of pay periods to calculate the amount withheld. 

- Tax withheld on check = $12.12 ($630/52 = $12.12)

There are a couple of issues that cause employees to not have enough taxes withheld.  

1. The employee has more than one job (or spouse works) and they did not check the  “multiple income” box on their W4.  Checking this box cuts the standard deduction in half resulting in an increase in taxable wages.  
2. Both spouses claim tax credits for the children.  If both spouses works only one of them should claim the tax credits for their dependent children.
